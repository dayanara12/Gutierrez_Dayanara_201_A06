Write your code in the *Code* cells of the **template provided** to write solutions for the assignment. **Do not open a new qmd**, and work from scratch. Ensure that the solution is written neatly enough to understand and grade.\n\n3. You may talk to a friend, discuss the questions and potential directions for solving them. However, you need to write your own solutions and code separately, and not as a group activity. Do not use AI to solve the problems.\n\n4. There are point deductions if your code is not clean and organized.\n\n5. Only print what is asked for. Highly inefficient code will be deducted for because it demonstrates lack of understanding.\n\n6. Render as an HTML and **submit BOTH the .qmd and HTML file**.\n\nThe grader cannot grade what they cannot see! Failure to render your document after completing all questions will lead to deductions.\n\n## Question 1 (5 points)\n\nLink your RStudio to your GitHub account and create a **public** repository where you will commit and push this assignment to. We will be following the instructions in [https://happygitwithr.com/](https://happygitwithr.com/) The chapters listed below are referring to this book.\n\n\nRefer to the **instructions html** for this question! The instructions to setup GitHub are not included in this template to save space.\n\n\nTo get full credit for this Question you must:\n  \n  - have a clickable link to your GitHub in the callout below\n  - have at least 5 **meaningful** commits pushed to GitHub. \n  - have your GitHub up to date (ie: assignment is complete on GitHub).\n  - insert a screenshot of RStudio that shows the project and Git. See instructions html for what needs to be visible in the screenshot.\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=false}\n\n## Github Repo Link\n\n[https://github.com/dayanara12/Gutierrez_Dayanara_201_A06.git](https://github.com/dayanara12/Gutierrez_Dayanara_201_A06.git)\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=false}\n\n## Screenshot/image of RStudio\n\n![(/Users/dayanaragutierrez/Desktop/Assignment6.png)](/Users/dayanaragutierrez/Desktop/Assignment6.png)\n\n:::\n\n\n## Question 2 (8 points)\n\nConsider the list of lists below containing basketball player information.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplayer_info <- list(MJ = list(name = \"Michael Jordan\",\n                              postion = \"shooting guard\",\n                              games_played = 179,\n                              points = 5987,\n                              assists = 1022),\n                    LJ = list(name = \"LeBron James\",\n                              postion = \"small forward\",\n                              games_played = 287,\n                              points = 8162,\n                              assists = 2067),\n                    KB = list(name = \"Kobe Bryant\",\n                              postion = \"shooting guard\",\n                              games_played = 220,\n                              points = 5640,\n                              assists = 1040),\n                    KA = list(name = \"Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\",\n                              postion = \"center\",\n                              games_played = 237,\n                              points = 5762,\n                              assists = 767),\n                    SO = list(name = \"Shaquille O'Neal\",\n                              postion = \"center\",\n                              games_played = 216,\n                              points = 5250,\n                              assists = 582))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Part a (1 point)\n\nExtract the value `8162` (LeBron James points) in 2 different ways:\n\n- using indexing \n- using names\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# using indexing \nplayer_info$LJ$points\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 8162\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# using names\nplayer_info [[\"LJ\"]]$points\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 8162\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Part b (3 points)\n\nAdd a new named element to the end of each player's list called `height`.
